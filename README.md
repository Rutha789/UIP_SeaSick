# UIP-Drunken-Sailor

Running this requires you to host a server (e.g. with MAMP) with the folder this readme
is located in as document root.
Access `localhost/index.html` to access the welcome screen.

Completion-wise:
* Welcome and user selection screens are implemented
* Customer page is fully implemented with the exception of the Food fatabase,
    as well as translation of attribute fields on the item info pop-ups.
* Management is page fully implemented with the exception of the Food database
    as well as translation of attribute fields on the item info pop-ups.
* Staff page has a very basic implementation:
    Orders made by customers are displayed in the sidebar and can be focused.
    Focused orders can be "completed" or "cancelled", which affects the stock.
